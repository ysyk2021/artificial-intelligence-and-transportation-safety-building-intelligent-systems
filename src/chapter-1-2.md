The purpose of this book is to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and transportation safety. AI has the potential to revolutionize transportation safety by enabling the development of intelligent systems that can analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns and correlations, and make predictions that can help to prevent accidents and improve overall safety on the road.

In this book, we will discuss the fundamentals of AI and machine learning, as well as their applications in transportation safety. We will explore different types of AI, including rule-based AI, machine learning-based AI, natural language processing-based AI, and computer vision-based AI, and their specific applications in transportation safety.

We will also examine case studies of how AI-powered intelligent systems have been used in transportation safety, including driver assistance systems, traffic management systems, and predictive maintenance systems. Additionally, we will discuss ethical considerations related to the use of AI in transportation safety, such as privacy concerns and the potential for bias in AI algorithms.

Overall, the goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the ways in which AI can be used to improve transportation safety. By understanding the latest developments and applications in the field, we hope to inspire new ideas and innovations that will help to save lives and reduce accidents on the road.
