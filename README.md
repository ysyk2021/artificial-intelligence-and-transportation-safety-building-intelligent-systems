Transportation safety is a critical issue that affects millions of people every day. According to the World Health Organization, road traffic accidents are one of the leading causes of death and injury worldwide. In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of intelligent transportation systems that have the potential to significantly improve road safety.

This book, "Artificial Intelligence and Transportation Safety: Building Intelligent Systems That Improve Road Safety," explores the ways in which AI is being used to improve transportation safety. The book will cover topics such as predictive analytics, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, and their applications in transportation safety.

The first part of the book will provide an overview of the current state of transportation safety, including the main causes of accidents and injuries on the road. It will also introduce the basics of AI and its potential applications in transportation safety.

The second part of the book will focus on specific applications of AI in transportation safety, including driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicles, and traffic management systems. It will discuss the benefits of using AI-powered transportation safety solutions and the potential risks and challenges associated with these technologies.

The third part of the book will examine the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in transportation safety. It will explore questions about the impact of AI on privacy, security, and liability, as well as the potential for bias and discrimination in AI systems.

By reading this book, you will gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which AI is transforming transportation safety and the potential benefits and challenges associated with these changes. Whether you are a researcher, engineer, policymaker, or simply interested in the latest developments in technology, this book will provide valuable insights into one of the most important issues of our time.
